## Introduction
This application is built for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2018. The problem is to find out when the next rocket launch is. And this application can exactly tell you about that including all other features like when, where, what is the payload, who is launching as well as live streaming links with all the information.

## The Application
The Application can be viewed from [here](https://nasa.zonayed.me/). This is completely working project but still there is a lot to add as new features in future.
